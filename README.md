# Mechatronics 0.1.4

A mod for [RimWorld](http://rimworldgame.com/) which allows you to construct your own mechanoids by salvaging parts from the marauding self-replicators. See the [forum post](http://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=3957.0) for more information.

NOTE: This was written for Alpha 4F, needs an update for compatibility with more recent versions of the game.
